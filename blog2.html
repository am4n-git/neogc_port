        <h1 class="blog-title">React with Redux</h1>
        <p>React is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries wich is used for front-end development. It has made our development easier and faster by providing the component based approach.<br />So to keep track of the data and handle the events in application developed using react, redux comes as a saviour and handles the data flow of the application from backend. </p>
        <br /> <br />

        <h1 class="blog-title">Why use Redux With React ?</h1>
        <div class="blog1-content">
        <br />
            <p>As we know React follows the component based approach, where the data flows through the components. In fact the data in React always flows from parent to child components which makes it unidirectional. <br /><br />
            So the application's state is contained in specific stores and as a result, the rest of the components remain loosely coupled.</p> <br />

        <h1 class="blog-title">What is Redux ?</h1>
        <div class="blog1-content">
        <br />
            <p>Redux is a predictable state container designed to help you write JavaScript apps that behave consistently across client, server, and native environments and are easy to test.
                <br /><br />
                While it’s mostly used as a state management tool with React, you can use it with any other JavaScript framework or library. It’s lightweight at 2KB (including dependencies), so you don’t have to worry about it making your application’s asset size bigger. <br /><br />
                
                With Redux, the state of your application is kept in a store, and each component can access any state that it needs from this store.</p> <br />

        <h1 class="blog-title">When to use Redux</h1>
        <div class="blog1-content">
        <br />
            <p>Lately one of the biggest debates in the frontend world has been about Redux. Not long after its release, Redux became one of the hottest topics of discussion. Many favored it while others pointed out issues. <br /><br /> 

                Redux allows you to manage your app’s state in a single place and keep changes in your app more predictable and traceable. It makes it easier to reason about changes occurring in your app. But all of these benefits come with tradeoffs and constraints. One might feel it adds up boilerplate code, making simple things a little overwhelming; but that depends upon the architecture decisions. <br /><br />
                
                One simple answer to this question is you will realize for yourself when you need Redux. If you’re still confused as to whether you need it, you don’t. This usually happens when your app grows to the scale where managing app state becomes a hassle; and you start looking out for making it easy and simple.</p> <br />

        <h1 class="blog-title">How Redux Works</h1>
        <div class="blog1-content">
        <br />
            <p>The way Redux works is simple. There is a central store that holds the entire state of the application. Each component can access the stored state without having to send down props from one component to another.<br /><br />

                There are three building parts: actions, store, and reducers. Let’s briefly discuss what each of them does. This is important because they help you understand the benefits of Redux and how it’s to be used. We’ll be implementing a similar example to the login component above but this time in Redux.</p> <br />

        <h1 class="blog-title">Conclusion</h1>
        <div class="blog1-content">
        <br />
            <p>We have discussed the general features of Redux and why Redux is beneficial to your app. While Redux has its benefits, that does not mean you should go about adding Redux in all of your apps. Your application might still work well without Redux.</p> <br />
