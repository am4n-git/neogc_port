        <h1 class="blog-title">React with Redux</h1>
        <p>React is one among the foremost popular JavaScript libraries wich is used in web development. It has made our development easier and faster by providing the component based approach.<br />So to stay on track of the info and handle the events in application developed using react, redux comes as a saviour and handles the info of the application from backend. </p>
        <br /> <br />

        <h1 class="blog-title">Why use Redux With React ?</h1>
        <div class="blog1-content">
        <br />
            <p>As we all know React follows the component based approach, where the inforamtion flows through the components. The info in React always flows from parent to child components which makes it unidirectional. <br /><br />
            Therefore the application's state is contained in specific stores and as a result, the remainder components remain loosely coupled.</p> <br />

        <h1 class="blog-title">What is Redux ?</h1>
        <div class="blog1-content">
        <br />
            <p>Redux could be a predictable state container designed to assist you write JavaScript apps that behave consistently across client, server, and native environments and are easy to check.
                <br /><br />
                While it’s mostly used as a state management tool with React, you will be able to use with other JavaScript framework or library. It’s lightweight at 2KB (including dependencies), so you don’t need to worry about it making your application’s asset size bigger. <br /><br />
                
                With Redux, the state of your application is kept inside the store, and every component can access any state that it needs from this store.</p> <br />

        <h1 class="blog-title">When to use Redux</h1>
        <div class="blog1-content">
        <br />
            <p>Lately one amongst the largest debates in web development has been about Redux. Shortly after it's release, Redux became one in every of the most popular topics of debate. <br /><br /> 

                Redux allows you to manage your app’s state in an exceedingly single place and keep changes in your app more predictable and traceable. It makes it easier to reason about changes occurring in your app. But all of these benefits include tradeoffs and constraints. One might feel it adds up boilerplate code, making simple things a touch overwhelming; but that depends upon the architecture decisions. <br /><br />
                
                One simple answer to the present question is you may realize for yourself once you need Redux. If you’re still confused on whether you need it, you don’t. This usually happens when your app grows to the dimensions where managing app state becomes a hassle, and you begin looking for creating it easy and straightforward.</p> <br />

        <h1 class="blog-title">How Redux Works</h1>
        <div class="blog1-content">
        <br />
            <p>The way Redux works is too straightforward. There's a central store that holds the complete state of the application. Each component can access the stored state without having to send props from one component to another.<br /><br />

                There are three building parts: actions, store, and reducers. Which are the most important part of the redux structure, which we will discussing in the next upcoming blog. Addition to this we will be implementing to the login component in Redux.</p> <br />

        <h1 class="blog-title">Conclusion</h1>
        <div class="blog1-content">
        <br />
            <p>We have discussed the general features of Redux and why Redux is useful to your app. While Redux has its benefits, that does'nt mean you need to go adding Redux in all of your apps. Your application might still work well without Redux.</p> <br />
